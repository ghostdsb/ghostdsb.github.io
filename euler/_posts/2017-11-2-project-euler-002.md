<h2>Even Fibonacci numbers</h2>
<div><p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:</p><p>1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</p><p>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p></div>

### Solution

{% highlight python %}
#pe002
fib = []
fib.append(1)
fib.append(2)
i = 1
while fib[i]<4000000:
	f3 = fib[i] + fib[i-1]
	fib.append(f3)
	i += 1
print(fib)
ans = sum([x for x in fib if x%2 == 0])

{% endhighlight %}
